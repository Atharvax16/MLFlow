1.End - to - End ML lifecycle management
-->MLFlow covers the entire ML lifecycle from experimentation to deployment and monitoring in one platform
2.Modular Design:
-Tracking --> Logs and queries experirments including code,data,configuration and results.
-Project --> Standardizes the way to package and share ML code.
-Models --> Manages model package and deployment across various environments.
-Registry --> fcailiattes model versioning,staging and deployment.
3.Flexible deployment options --> supports multiple deployment targets including REST APIS,cloud services and 
on-premise systems.
4.Interoperability --> Works well with various ML libraries and tools such as Tensorflow,pytorch,scikit-learn,XGBoost
5.Open-source
6.Model registry --> if i sabve the model name like aharva then it will save it atharva1,atharva 2,etc
7.Build in experiement comaprison --> easy comaprison
8.Seamless Integration--> integrates CI/CD pipeline,supoorts GIT,CI/CD like jenkins,Github Actions
9.User-friendly
10.Scalability
