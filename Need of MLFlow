Why Do we need MLFlow?

stakeholders     who knows the depth of the model


Experiment Tracking in MlLOps
--> It is the process of recording all the details of ML expriemets.This includes configuration,code version,
datasets,metrics and results.

Why it's used in MLOps?
-->1.Reproducibility
Ensures exp can be repeated with the same settings, helping to verify results
2.Comparison
Make it easy to compare diffrent models and exp to find the best performing one
3.Collaboration
Allow team members to share and review each others work enhancing teamwork
4.Efficiency
Saves time by avoiding repeated work and helps i quickly findinh the best mdoels and settings
5.)Auditability
Keeps a history of all exp,useful for tracking progress and compillance purposes


1.)Experiimentation tracking
2.)Model Logging / Registry  --> to see which is better than the other
  Parameters       requirements.txt
  metrics          conda 
  loss
  save 

for packaging we use DOCKER integrated in MLFlow
3.)Model Evaluation --> Regression,classification (model.evaluate) will give the metrics insisde the 
MLFlow UI for example:Confusion)mat,AUC-ROC
4.)Model Deployment --> throug registry --> best models
5.)Hyperparameter tuning --> Multiple experiemnets right? so it track that and locks the best parameter values
