Why Do we need MLFlow?

Experiment Tracking in MlLOps
--> It is the process of recording all the details of ML expriemets.This includes configuration,code version,
datasets,metrics and results.

Why it's used in MLOps?
-->1.Reproducibility
Ensures exp can be repeated with the same settings, helping to verify results
2.Comparison
Make it easy to compare diffrent models and exp to find the best performing one
3.Collaboration
Allow team members to share and review each others work enhancing teamwork
4.Efficiency
Saves time by avoiding repeated work and helps i quickly findinh the best mdoels and settings
5.)Auditability
Keeps a history of all exp,useful for tracking progress and compillance purposes


1.)Experiimentation tracking
2.)Model Logging / Registry
