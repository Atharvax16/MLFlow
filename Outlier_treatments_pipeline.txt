Outlier Treatment
-->1.)Winsorizer
in that there are capping methods
1.Gaussian(mean-sigma) capping
-->It assumes the feature is roughly normal
   Sets limit at mean +- k(sigma) anything beyond is capped to those limits
   Good when the distribution is symmetric/bell-shaped after possible transfroms

2.IQR(interquartile range) capping
-->Uses quartiles and IQR = Q3 - Q1
   Typical limits:
	Lower: Q1 -1.5* IQR
	Upper: Q3 + 1.5*IQR
3.Quantile/percentile capping
-->Directly uses percentiles e.g cap everything below the 1st percentile to the 1st percentile value and everything above the 99th to the 99th value

4.MAD(Median Absolute Deviation) based capping
-->Compute median m and MAD = median(|xi - m|)
sets limits at m +- k * MAD
very robust to heavy tails and extreme outliers because it uses medians.
